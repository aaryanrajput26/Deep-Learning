# Deep-Learning

1. Tensor Creation

1D, 2D, and 3D tensors

NumPy arrays vs PyTorch tensors

2. Basic Operations

Element-wise:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

3. Linear Algebra Operations

Dot product (1D vectors)

Matrix multiplication

4. Indexing and Slicing

Basic indexing

Row and column extraction

Boolean masking

Sub-tensor extraction

5. Tensor Reshaping

PyTorch:

.view()

.reshape()

.unsqueeze()

.squeeze()

NumPy:

.reshape()

Comparison between PyTorch and NumPy reshaping behavior

6. Broadcasting

Operations on tensors with different shapes

Broadcasting rules in NumPy and PyTorch

7. In-place vs Out-of-place Operations

Memory-efficient in-place operations

Risks with autograd in PyTorch
